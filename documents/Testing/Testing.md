<h3>Validation</h3>
<p>In order to ensure my code has meet the various standards, I have used the following validation services to test different elements of my code. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href=”https://validator.w3.org/” target="_blank">W3C Markup Validation</a> was used to validate HTML code.</li>
<li><a href=”https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/” target="_blank">W3C CSS Validation</a> was used to validate CSS code.</li>
<li><a href=”https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/” target="_blank">JS Hint</a> was used to validate Javascript code.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the validation tests resulted in a few minor changes that I needed to make, and all my files now conform to the latest web standards. </p>

<h2>Client Stories</h2>
<p>The following section demonstrates where the user stories have been met in regards  to  functionality and design choice.</p>
<h3> User story 1 - As a user, I would like to be able to find new, popular courses to play around the country.</</h3>
<h4>Homepage</h4>
<ol>
<li>When the user lands on the homepage of the website, they are greeted with a featured course section. This section generates a random course to feature for that session. As a result, this could expose the user to a variety of different course, each time the visit the homepage. As a result I feel this successfully meets the user story. </li>
<li>The homepage also contains a search section, which allows the user to search for a any course on the site via a number of different filters. For example the user can search for a course by its name, or can choose to create a more open query by selecting a region or minimum star rating. This means the user is able to easily find new courses around the country, meeting the user story.</li>
<li>The homepage also contains a popular courses section, which presents the three most popular courses at that particular moment in time. This is another opportunity for users to find courses on the site. </li>
</ol>
<h3> User story 2 - As a user, I would like to be able to find golf courses which have a good reputation so as to ensure its quality </h3>
<h4>Star Rating System</h4>
<ol>
<li>In order to meet this user criteria, I implemented a rating system in the form of a star rating system. The main reason I choose this is that it is familiar to all users and is a easy visual way of seeing what others think of a golf course. The star rating works on a 1-5 star rating and also displays the number of reviews left on certain parts of the website. </li>
<li>Users are able to affect the rating of the different courses by being able to leave reviews if they are a registered user. This enables the star ratings to be generated for each of the courses. Thanks to these reviews, a user is then able to see clearly the quality of each course being viewed and is then able to come to a decision on course. </li>
</ol>
<h3> User story 3 - As a user, I would like to discover new golf courses that I haven’t played before </h3>
<h4>Featured Course</h4>
<ol>
<li>As mentioned previously, in order to meet this user criteria, I implemented a featured course section near on the homepage, as this would see a lot a traffic. The main idea around the featured course, was to give the user an opportunity to discover new courses that they maybe had not seen before. In future this featured section could be used to feature courses based on a users preferences or past search history. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Popular Course</h4>
<ol>
<li>As mentioned previously, another way in which I tried to meet this criteria was to include a popular courses section. This section is generated based on the three most reviewed courses on the platform. As a result, this system has a high chance of exposing the user to courses which they may not have played before. </li>
</ol>





<h4>Search Course</h4>
<ol>
<li>As mentioned previously, one other way in which I have tried to implement this user story was to allow the user to search in broad terms. By this I mean allowing the user to search using a region or star rating filter. As a result, this system is likely to provide the user with a number of courses they may not have previously played, based on the criteria they have searched. For instance, a user may search by the region Yorkshire, which will likely bring back a number of courses which the user has not seen before. Furthermore, the rating system will allow the user to quickly see the quality of the course as well. </li>
</ol>

<h3> User story 4 - As a user, I would like to create reviews in order to allow me to share my experience of a golf course with other users
</h3>
<h4>Manage Review</h4>
<ol>
<li>In order to meet this user story, I implemented a system which would allow the user to easily create reviews for any course they viewed, if they are a registered user. The review consists of a title, description and a star rating. When a user loads a course which has a review, they will be able to see the review in its entirety posted below the course view, with all of its details. This allows the person creating the review to fully express their opinions and experiences for others to see. The star rating also is very crucial to the review system, as all of the reviews left for a course will generate an average rating for the course. This average rating will then be displayed on the overview card of the course. As a result, I believe this functionality fully meets the user story. </li>
<li>Another element to this user story, was to allow the user the ability to manage the review once it was created. This was achieved by creating a management page, where the user is able to see all of the reviews that they have created. From this page, they are then able to edit and delete any of the reviews, which provides a greater level of functionality when it comes to their ability to leave reviews.</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<h3> User story 5 - As a user, I would like to see featured and popular courses when I first enter the site </h3>
<h4>Popular Courses</h4>
<ol>
<li>As mentioned previously, the way in which I tried to meet this criteria was to include a popular courses section. This section is generated based on the three most reviewed courses on the platform. Hence it shows the user the courses which are being reviewed the most and are popular. </li>
</ol>
<h3> User story 6 - As a user, I would like to go directly to the golf courses website </h3>
<h4>Course View</h4>
<ol>
<li>When a user views a course in detail, this gives the user the option to redirect to a website where the user can book to play the golf course. This can be the courses actual website, or this could be a booking site. This allows the user an easy and convenient way to book a course, once they have found one they the like the look of. </li>
</ol>
<h3> User story 7 - As a user, I would like to be able to manage a number of aspects around the creation and management of golf courses on the website </h3>
<h4>Course Management</h4>
<ol>
<li>In order to meet this particular user story, I have created a course management system, which allows an administrator to create, update and delete courses. As a result, courses can be easily managed and can all be done from the same page, which makes the process efficient and easy for the user. </li>
</ol>
